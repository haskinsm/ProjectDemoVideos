# ProjectDemoVideos
Will contain demo videos of projects I have done. I cannot provide a link for some web dev projects as Trinity credentials are required to view them. 

- script 2 (Code location: PythonProjects/app.py): See DemoOfPythonDashboard.mp4 in this repo. Created a dashboard from 3 datasets on data.gov.ie. Datasets were read in from 
URLs using urrlib, code was also written to read the datasets in from the data.gov.ie API. The datasets were stored as Pandas dataframes and the data was 
then cleaned and merged. I then created a Plotly Dash Dashboard, and used an external CSS stylesheet to style the created webpage. Several interactive graphs
were then created to visualize the data, the homeless situation in Ireland during 2020. When this program is run enter 'http://127.0.0.1:8050/' in your web 
browser and the dashboard should be visible and interactive.
